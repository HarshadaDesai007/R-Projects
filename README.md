# R-Projects
- Twitter is one of the most popular social networking site used for microblogging.
- Each tweets are restricted to 280 characters.
- All over the world, twitter is used as a platform to convey oneâ€™s emotions.
- Some companies even target on analysing these emotions on a particular topic for various purposes.
- The aim of the project is to build a model to detect and summarise the sentiments using the tweets on random topics. 

## Sentiment Analysis
- It is a text mining technique to extract, identify and study the polarity of a given text or document.
- The results show whether the emotion conveyed in the document is positive, or negative
- In principle, the accuracy of a sentiment analysis system is determined by how well it finds similarity with human judgments.
- This is usually calculated by different measures based on precision and recall over the two target variables of negative and positive texts.

##Data set
- The training set is an excel file that contains 200,000 rows and 6 columns.
- The six fields of the training set are:
  1. the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative and 4 = positive).
  2.the id of the tweet.
  3.the date of the tweet.
  4.the query. If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
  5.the user that tweeted.
  6.the text of the tweet.
- A test set with 50,000 rows of tweets and emotions are used for predicting the sentiments.
